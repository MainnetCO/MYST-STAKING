# MYST-STAKING DASHBOARD
> DASHBOARD
- zip attached
- connect wallet must include METAMASK & WALLETCONNECT (walletconnect.com)
- Please ignore the MXST token, we will use that later, for now they can only stake BUSD

1. User Deposits BUSD
2. It is locked for 28 days
3. There is a history on the right where they see how long is left of the lock period
4. They cannot withdraw early (28 days minimum)
5. They get daily rewards, these can be withdrawn every day. 
6. These can also be redeposited so that they continue earning compounded amounts...... each time they redeposit, it is a new 28 days (even the rewards)
7. Each time they deposit, or "redeposit" a 3% fee is taken

> The staking contract is also attached

> We would like 4 buttons:
WITHDRAW - just withdraws
WITHDRAW + DEPOSIT - basically withdraws and redeposits at the same time (not maunal)
CLAIM REWARD - claims rewards
CLAIM + COMPOUND - claims and redeposits automatically
